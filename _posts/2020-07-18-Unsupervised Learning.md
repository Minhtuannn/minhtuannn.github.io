##  Find structure of the dataset? 
Unsupervised Learning will decied that data live in some cluster!

## Approach problems with a little or no idea what our results should look like -> derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of variables 

-> Clustering data based on relationships among the variables in the data
